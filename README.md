# BattMon
This repository holds the Arduino software for controlling 6328's pit-cart Battery Monitor system. 

The system is based on an Arduino Mega, with photocell sensors mounted on each "charged" indicator 
on the battery chargers, and individual addressable RGB LEDs mounted by each battery charge connector.
